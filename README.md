# Hi there ðŸ‘‹, I'm Soonwon :)

I'm a data scientist at Lotte Data Communication Company.
I majored in biomedical engineering with AI, but now I'm processing data in the field of distribution/service/manufacturing.
These days, I'm trying to solve problems by designing traditional machine learning models rather than deep learning models.
But, I am an AI enthusiast who is studying steadily.
